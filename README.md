This is a fullstack application for a blog.
The frontend will be used with React and Typescript.
The backend was built with Express as the Javascript framework. 
THe database we used was MongoDB.
If you run npm run dev you will be able to use concurrently so that both the client and server will be ran at the same time. 
If you are interested in just the frontend or just the backend you can see more instructions on how each is ran.
More instructions to run the client and server will be provided within each folder's directory.
